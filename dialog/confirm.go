// Confirm is a generic y/N confirmation dialog. It renders a prompt as its
// body and resolves to ResultSubmit when accepted or ResultClose when
// declined, exposing the decision through Confirmed. It defaults to not
// confirmed, so a dialog abandoned any other way - escape, or a lost overlay
// the Stack drops - is read as a decline, the safe default for a guard in
// front of a destructive action.
//
// It carries pointer semantics: Update mutates and returns the same value, so
// the caller reads Confirmed off the very pointer the Stack pops.

// Stack has popped the dialog: a Confirm resolved with ResultSubmit reports
// true, and one that was closed - or is still open - reports false.

// y/Y/enter accept and submit; n/N/esc decline and close. The outcome is
