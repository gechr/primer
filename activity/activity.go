// Package activity is the observational record of user-facing mutations in a
// Bubble Tea app: it feeds a footer's status slot (the most-recent operation
// and an in-flight count) and a scrollable operation-log overlay (every
// recorded mutation, newest-first). It is deliberately observational - it
// records what a mutation is doing and how it resolved, but it never gates a
// write. Callers keep their own re-entrancy guards; the registry only
// watches. Every method runs on the single Bubble Tea Update goroutine, so
// the registry needs no locking (mirroring package task); it owns no
// goroutines of its own.
